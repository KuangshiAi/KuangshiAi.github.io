Hi thereðŸ‘‹! I'm **Kuangshi Ai**, a first-year Ph.D. student in Computer Science and Engineering at the University of Notre Dame, where I work with Prof. [Chaoli Wang](https://sites.nd.edu/chaoli-wang/) in the ND-VIS Lab. I received my bachelorâ€™s degree in Artificial Intelligence and Data Science from Fudan University.

My research interests lie at the intersection of **scientific visualization**, **human-computer interaction**, and **natural language processing**. Currently, I focus on leveraging large language models (LLMs) to make the complex, expert-oriented process of scientific visualization more intuitive and accessible to broader audiences. I'm also exploring the integration of LLMs with 3D/4D data, including general vision-language models for volumetric and spatial understanding.

If you're interested in my work or would like to collaborate, feel free to reach out at [kai@nd.edu](mailto:kai@nd.edu).

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
